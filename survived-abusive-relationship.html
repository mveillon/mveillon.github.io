		<h1> To those who survived an abusive relationship: You are worthy of love and no one can take that away </h1>
		<p>
			I don’t care about your gender, your age, your sexual orientation, your race, or any other part of your backstory. You’re here because you have survived one of the most cruel things in this world, and all of those things can be used to invalidate your experience. If you’re invalidating yourself for any reason – take a moment and listen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abuse can come in so many forms. It can be physical, emotional, sexual. It can be a two-way street. It can be unintentional. It can be so skillfully disguised that you don’t even recognize it as abuse. It can be so sick and twisted that you might blame yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know. I know, I know, I know. I won’t go so far as to say that I’ve been abused, because I don’t think that’s the right word. But I have been in relationships that were cruel and unfair. I’ve been in relationships with power-imbalances that I didn’t even realize were there. I’ve felt small and insignificant because of the treatment I’ve received, and I have fallen into deep depression and self-hatred, at least in part, because of unhealthy relationships.
		</p>
		<p>
			It took me several years to recognize the unfair and cruel qualities of my first relationship. I spent all of that time invalidating myself, blaming myself, and hating myself. To this day, I still question myself. I still wonder if maybe it wasn’t actually his fault.
		</p>
		<p>
			But the truth is...it doesn’t really matter anymore. What matters is, my first experience with love made me feel unworthy. It made me feel worthless. And that has stuck with me.
		</p>
		<p>
			My god, it has hurt. When I finally recognized what had happened – how I was treated – I felt sick 24/7. I had several breakdowns per week. I cried so damn much, and I would want to tear my skin off because I felt like I could still feel his fingerprints, coating me like gasoline, ready to set flame to everything I was.
		</p>
		<p>
			I won’t tell anyone that it won’t be painful. I won’t lie, and I won’t sugar-coat it.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I will tell you is that recognizing that you were wronged does not make you a bad person.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I will tell you is that feeling pain does not make you weak.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I will tell you is that being angry is fair.
		</p>
		<p>
			And what I will tell you, again and again and again, is that you are still worthy of love.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s damn easy to feel tainted. To feel like you’ve been ruined, broken, or that what someone else has done to you makes you bad. It. Does. Not.
		</p>
		<p>
			You have every right to take time to mourn.
		</p>
		<p>
			You have every right to take time to heal.
		</p>
		<p>
			But I can make a promise to you:
		</p>
		<p>
			There are good people in the world. There are people who will never blame you for what has been done to you. There are people who will care for you until you feel worthy again. There are people who would rather die than cause you harm. And more than anything else: one day, someone is going to prove to you that, after all of the pain you’ve felt, love will always be stronger than all of the cruelty that has ever existed.
		</p>
		<p>
			No one has the right to take away your self-respect. One day you will walk by that person who tried to, and you will look them dead in the eyes. And they will run.
