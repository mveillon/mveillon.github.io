		<h1> Not Just a Man </h1>
		<p> 
			Anthony, an idiot, wanted to get Chinese food with his girlfriend for lunch. He was walking around downtown Portland when his stomach started to growl. He turned to this girlfriend, Brittany, and looked deep into her eyes. Her pupils swelled up in size and his white supremist mind saw the Chinese character for love. He could not resist the call of steamed vegetables. </p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Brittany just got some steamed tilapia, but Anthony was trying to watch his figure. Starving but trying to preserve his diet, he filled the void in his stomach with an endless plate of bok choy. To be fair, it was delicious, and Anthony had not enjoyed food in three weeks. Eventually, he did fill himself up and pay before going to the gym to do some cross-fit. Anthony is the worst. Carl, on the other hand, is super cool and everyone loves him. At least they would if he was not born with such a large hunchback, but that is not his fault and it is not fair to hold that against him. It’s a condition. However, this story is not about me. I mean Carl. </p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Anyway, stupid Anthony got home from the stupid gym and ate his stupid kale casserole for dinner. All he cared about was health. His whole life was centered around it. The joke is on him though. He started to feel sick and even started throwing up. After a couple of hours, his hands started glowing red like a traffic light and his face started to clear up. See, Anthony gave himself hypervitaminosis A, which is an overdose on vitamin A as a result of being a no-good jerk. The next morning, he woke up with arms the size of barrels and he could see the ants on his yard three stories below. His skin also cleared up noticeably, but that is less of a superpower. That does not stop Carl from being jealous. Carl has tried everything to get rid of his acne, but to no avail. Maybe if Anthony stopped harassing Carl, he would not be so stressed out all the time and his skin would be healthier. ></p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Brittany was also feeling sick, although she just had some food poisoning and no superpowers. Anthony felt bad about her feeling ill and rested his radioactive-looking hand on her face. The glow from his hand transferred to and surrounded her body. She closed her eyes and furrowed her brow as the aura engulfed her. After about 30 seconds, it returned to Anthony’s hand and Brittany immediately felt completely cured. Realizing what that vitamin had bestowed upon him, Anthony rushed to the hospital. He spent the entire afternoon healing patients in his home city of Portland, talking to them and hearing out their story, and making everyone else look bad. </p> 
		<br>
		<p>
		Hear me out, ok? I mean hear Carl out. When people get vaccines, they inject strains of the virus in question into their body. The sickness strengthens their immune system and allows them to fight it off in the future. When Anthony goes around healing sick people left and right, he is actually hurting them in the long term. Knowing this, Carl had to put a stop to it immediately. He started training, using legitimately effective workout routines unlike cross-fit. On an unrelated note, he grew a strange affinity with oranges and bell peppers. He became quite jacked and called himself C-Man with the plan of c-blocking Anthony from his treachery. He did not understand why people always laughed when he declared his name. </p>
		<br>
		<p>
	C-Man was awesome because he was a genius. He had a photographic memory and used it to pioneer incredible inventions. He had to be creative to defeat Anthony, because he knew he could not kill the healer or even hurt him. However, C-Man discovered a probable weakness: a zinc deficiency. Zinc is found in a lot of foods and it is very hard to cover all the necessary bases. C-Man, in all his brilliance, became Anthony’s personal chef, promising to keep him healthy and able to do all his stupid saving the world things. Meanwhile, he researched every food he gave Anthony and gradually weakened him to the point where he was bed-ridden. He refused to get a doctor, maintaining that he could heal himself. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Then his scum girlfriend came to the rescue. Realizing she had to pick up where Anthony left off, Brittany intentionally consumed each kind of vitamin B as much as she could. Somehow it turned her body into that of a dog’s, and she started to call herself B-Gal. B-Gal had an incredible sense of smell and with it came equally impressive detective skills. She quickly sniffed out C-Man’s scheme and treated Anthony with zinc supplements, bringing him back to full power. C-Man had to pretend to throw a tennis ball to escape her grasp. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	While B-Gal was chasing the ball, C-Man turned to Anthony while he was still recovering. “You’re not special. You’re just a man,” he said. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Anthony put his hands on his hips, lifted his chin towards the bright blue sky, and said,  “I’m not just any man. I’m A-Man.” The damage was done, though. C-Man had found the weakness in A-Man’s armor. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	A-Man became famous, with every Portland newspaper featuring him on the front page. The only exception was The Oregon Journal, which focused more on a couple of puppies who befriended the local stray cat. He created a costume, not because he wanted to protect his identity, but because all his extra personality wanted the extra glory of being a superhero. He developed a catch-phrase and was way too proud of it. “Get busy living or get busy iodying.” So stupid. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	“It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s a man!” people would say. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	“In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. A-Man,” others would call. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
	A-Man considered differentiating between his heroic identity and his civilian life as Anthony. He decided against it because he was a selfish and anti-social screw-up. The only person he needed to protect from his enemies, namely C-Man, was Brittany. He figured, with powers of her own, she could more than take care of herself. He vastly underestimated C-Man. It has not come back to bite him yet, but it will. C-Man will figure it out. He is super smart, you know. </p>
