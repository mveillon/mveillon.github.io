		<h1> It's ok to be scared of relationships. They're scary. </h1>
		<p>
			You know what? I’m going to start right off with a truly mind-blowing fact:
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Being afraid of relationships probably means you understand them better than those who don’t fear them at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Seriously. You are not weak or unreasonable for fearing relationships. You’re probably recognizing the truth: that relationships are hard, and there is so much risk involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m not trying to discourage you from dating. Dating isn’t a bad thing. I wouldn’t be writing this blog if I thought dating was a bad thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I am saying is that your fear is reasonable. Relationships are full of risk, you’re right.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s a risk to put time and energy into something that might not last.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s a risk to put your heart out there where it can get hurt so easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s a risk to let someone see your authentic self, from every angle.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			It’s a risk to be vulnerable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Vulnerability can get you in all kinds of trouble. And that’s why I say that it’s valid to be afraid. But there’s a difference between caution and avoidance. Being cautious about relationships – choosing your partners carefully, taking things slow – that’s almost always just a good idea. But if you’re avoiding dating at all costs because of your fear…
		</p>
		<p>
			...Well, yes. You will avoid risk. You will avoid pain and loss. But you will also avoid the possibility of having a meaningful connection with someone in this way. I get it, I really do. But don’t miss out on joy just because you’re afraid of the risk.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Everything in life comes with risk. Everything.
		</p>
		<p>
			But a relationship with love and respect, with fun and joy – in my opinion, that’s worth the risk.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s a tricky balance. But I hope you’ll give it a chance, when it’s right, even despite the risk.
		</p>
		<p>
			And honestly? Think about what your life would be like if you never took any risks. You would never make new friends, never try anything new, never even leave the house. Yes, exiting your home is a risk. Breathing is a risk, for that matter. And of course you should calculate bigger risks to keep yourself from being just plain stupid. But keep in mind the fact that risk is everywhere, and there’s really no avoiding it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The question now is: how can I tell if a relationship is worth the risk? Well, I can’t answer that for you. That’s something only you can answer. But I trust you to know yourself and now where to draw the line. And besides, everyone makes mistakes. It’s impossible to know the outcome of every choice you make. It’s okay if things don’t exactly go quite right every time.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Love is like a game of poker.
		</p>
		<p>
			You have to choose your bets wisely. But you can’t fold every time. Otherwise, you’re barely even playing the game. Why even bother?
		</p>
		<p>
			If the idea of playing poker is terrifying to you, welcome to the club. I use this metaphor a little bit hypocritically – I’ve never played poker in my life, and I probably never will. But I’ve played my fair share of relationship poker, and yeah, I’ve lost a few times. But I’ve also won.
		</p>
		<p>
			I suppose what I’m saying is that choosing to never try is not unlike shooting yourself in the foot. If you never take a chance, you’ll always lose.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, I say all of this to remind you that it really is okay to be nervous about relationships. You don’t need to feel like a coward – it’s not cowardly to acknowledge that something is scary.
		</p>
		<p>
			But your life will be richer if you do place a bet every now and then. Even if you lose, you’ve still gained something. Whether it’s knowledge of yourself, knowledge of the world, or just a little more wisdom about love in general, you’ve gained something.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			I think that’s worth it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you do too.
