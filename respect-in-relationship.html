		<h1> Do you feel respected in your relationship? </h1>
		<p> May 2nd, 2019 </p>
		<p>
			People often say that respect is the foundation of a relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think that’s true. But it does need to be mutual. There is no exception to this rule.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imbalanced respect can lead to a power imbalance, and couples should always see themselves as equals. And, if you think about it, respect is a very basic part of what makes people consider one another as equals.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know, I know. This is common knowledge. Everyone has heard this a thousand times. But I’m repeating it because it’s true, and because it’s not always obvious if that mutual respect isn’t there.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Here are some examples of things your partner could do that aren’t respectful to you:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Not listening to you. Whether it’s about where to go to dinner tonight, or what you’re thinking and feeling, your partner should be listening to you. That doesn’t mean they have to always agree, but they do need to listen.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pressuring. Pressuring isn’t limited to sex; it can come up in almost any context. It can easily turn into someone attempting to assert their wishes over your own.
			</li>
			<li>
				Holding power over you. This can be anything from extensive guilt-tripping to controlling what you do or who you hang out with. A relationship is a partnership, not a battle for control.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The list could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. A couple things to keep in mind: 1. These things can come up in a very small and subtle ways, but they still matter, and they still aren’t respectful. 2. You could also end up doing something like this without even knowing it. Keeping an awareness of what mutual respect looks like, as well as a lack thereof, can be enough to make sure you never find yourself using any of these tactics unknowingly.
		</p>
		<p>
			For now, though, we’ll focus on the question at hand: do you feel respected in your relationship?
		</p>
		<p>
			If you’re continuously feeling like you’re not getting the respect you deserve, take a moment to think about it. Even if you can’t think of a reason for feeling this way right now, be open to the idea that there is a logical reason for the way you’re feeling. Ask yourself:
		</p>
		<p>
			Is there something my partner/I am doing that is causing me not to feel heard?
		</p>
		<p>
			Is there something my partner/I am doing that is causing me to feel unwanted or not good enough?
		</p>
		<p>
			I include you as a possible cause of these feelings not because I want you to blame yourself, but because sometimes, without noticing, we sort of shoot ourselves in the foot. Often people don’t feel heard and instinctively blame their partner, then realize after talking to them that they never properly voiced their feelings in the first place. Communication is hard, and sometimes fear gets in the way.
		</p>
		<p>
			On a very related note, insecurity can also give you that feeling of not being respected. It’s a separate issue though, because the lack of respect is coming from yourself. It’s just something to think about.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do sense that there is something causing these feelings, question what kind of impact this is having on you or your relationship. Is it bad enough that you are feeling your trust in your partner dwindling? Or is it something that is nagging at the back of your mind?
		</p>
		<p>
			If you’re starting to feel a lack of trust, that is a major red flag. Of course, every relationship is different, so it may not be time to put on the brakes just yet. But be wary. Trust is just as essential as respect, and they can easily be tied together.
		</p>
		<p>
			If it’s something bothering you from time to time but you can’t quite make sense of it, consider talking to your partner about it. As always, communication is hard. But it’s pretty essential too.
		</p>
		<p>
			I guess there are a lot of essential parts of a relationship, aren’t there…
		</p>
		<p>
			...Anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before I go, I’ll say what you all knew I would say from the beginning (I know, I’m very predictable):
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			You are worthy of respect and love in your relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may question it sometimes, and you may not believe it sometimes. But I’ll be here to rub it in your face and annoy you no matter what.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			The takeaway:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Always look out for a lack of respect, both in your partner, and in yourself
			</li>
			<li>
				Keep in mind that it isn’t necessarily intentional, and can be subtle
			</li>
			<li>
				Remind yourself that you are worthy of that respect
			</li>
			<li>
				Remind yourself that without constant communication of what’s on your mind, your relationship may suffer. Don’t be afraid to talk.
			</li>
			<li>
				Demanding respect is not unreasonable. It’s vital.
			</li>
