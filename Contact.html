		<h1> Why doesn't this website work with "www." in front of the URL? </h1>
		<p>
			Good question. We understand this is something that many users take for granted because in all honesty, it is not that hard to make that work. We acknowledge that is a serious issue with the website. We're just not that good at coding here at Imperfectionate. Michael, the fool responsible for all the coding, tried to fix it and the site went down for half a day so he got scared and gave up. If you have any suggestions, you can email Michael using the link below. Please be nice because he is a sensitive boi.
