		<h1> For those doubting if they deserve their partner: </h1>
		<p> 
			In my first relationship, I had this idea that I didn’t deserve the person I was dating. I told myself that I wasn’t good enough for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was several years ago. Earlier this year, I realized that they actually took advantage of that feeling of inferiority.
		</p>
		<p>
			They had a temper, and they occasionally would take it out on me. If I ever did anything wrong, or if they were under the impression that I had, they would get angry. And I took it, every word. In fact, I embraced it, agreed with them, and hated myself more and more every time.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the relationship I’m in now, I often feel this disbelief, an utter lack of understanding as to why my partner wants to be with me. I can’t really help it, he just seems so amazing to me and, because I am in my own head, I can’t see what he sees in me. But I have learned that,
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			If someone says they want to be with me, there’s no point in arguing over the validity or reasoning for their feelings.
		</p>
		<p>
			I may never understand what makes my partner love me, and that’s just something I have to accept. And he may never understand what makes me love him. But he is part of the inspiration for this post – he always says, “If someone doesn’t want to be with me but is staying with me anyway, that’s their problem.” In other words, if someone doesn’t want to be with you, they need to be the one ending it. If they don’t, then they need to figure their priorities out.
		</p>
		<p>
			The truth is, you may never feel like you truly deserve your partner. You can’t always logic your way out of your feelings. But there is one thing I do believe, something that has helped me a lot:
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			It won’t help you to agonize over whether you deserve your partner or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s as simple as that. Regardless of what you’re worrying about, it just won’t help to torture yourself over this. Ultimately, I think it makes things worse.
		</p>
		<p>
			I say that for a number of reasons. One of them is what happened to me in my first relationship. It’s pretty obvious that, in that case, it actually served to harm me and put me in an unfair position. But there are so many ways that this can hurt not only you, but your relationship. Let’s go through a few.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			1. You need to be able to stand up for yourself in a relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your partner can’t read your mind. They won’t know if something is bothering you, and they won’t know what you need or want unless you tell them. And if you don’t feel like you’re worth your partner’s time, you might not feel like you should speak up.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don’t listen to that voice in your head. It’s there to make you feel bad. Tell it to shut it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here’s the scary truth: you are going to have to do some serious and stressful communicating in your relationship (gasp). If you don’t think you deserve to have your voice heard, things will go south very fast.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don’t ask for what you need and stand up for yourself, your partner might (totally unknowingly) do things that bother you or make you uncomfortable.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your partner does things that bother you or make you uncomfortable, you might start to resent them or want to distance yourself from the relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			And if you start to resent them or distance yourself from them, they might feel guilty and confused because they don’t know what they did wrong.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you really care about the person you’re with, I’ll wager you don’t want those things to happen. Seriously, you deserve to have your voice heard, and what’s more, your partner deserves to know what’s going on for you. It’s a two-way street, always always always.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			2. Insecurities are one thing. But outright hating yourself can actually hurt your partner, too.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not unrelated to #1, feeling bad about yourself (beyond a certain point of course), can actually harm your relationship and your partner.
		</p>
		<p>
			Switch the roles for a second. How would you feel if your partner was always talking in a self-deprecating way, or refusing to stand up for their own needs? You would feel sad, right? You would want to help them, make them see why they’re the best thing since the recipe for ice cream was written, right? Well...hate to break this to ya. But your partner is probably thinking that exact thing about you. And if they’re trying desperately to prove to you that you are worth it, but they aren’t having any success...they’ll feel horrible too. They’ll feel like a failure. I know you don’t want that for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m not saying any of this to make you feel guilty. I say it only as a call for awareness of how your actions may affect your partner, even in situations where you might assume that they won’t affect them at all. Just take a moment and consider how the way you treat yourself may affect them. No guilt is necessary.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			3. If your partner has chosen to be with you, you have to respect their decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a big one.
		</p>
		<p>
			If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that feelings are complicated and confusing and usually completely illogical. So how can you argue with someone over why they have feelings for you? They just do. And that’s okay.
		</p>
		<p>
			You know what? I’m just going to say it:
		</p>
		<p>
			Forget why they like you. They like you and it’s amazing and wonderful and that’s it. Just enjoy it.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			4. If nothing else, constant reassurance is exhausting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even the most patient person on the planet gets a little annoyed sometimes. I consider myself to be a pretty patient person. And people who are constantly asking for reassurance can be so exhausting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once again, this is not meant as a guilt-trip. It’s okay, we all do it sometimes. I know I have. But somewhere along the line, I realized that when someone is always asking, “are you sure you like me?” “am I annoying you?” “do you hate me now?”, it just makes you crazy. And you know why?
		</p>
		<p>
			BECAUSE THEY WOULDN’T BE HANGING OUT WITH YOU IF THEY HATED YOU.
		</p>
		<p>
			Face it: you’re cool and people want to hang out with you. Presumably, someone wants to actually date you. That means you’re cool. Fight me.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			5. You deserve some peace of mind. Trust your partner when they tell you that they want to be with you.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know I’ve been a little impatient today. But it’s all because I want you to understand and internalize the idea that, maybe it doesn’t matter why someone likes you or whether you “deserve them.” If your partner is telling you that they like you, and that they want to be with you, it’s okay to trust them and stop worrying.
		</p>
		<p>
			I repeat:
		</p>
		<p class = 'italics'>
			It’s okay to stop worrying.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that you’ve made it to the end of this list, I’ll let you in on a secret I’ve been keeping. It might sound a little crazy, so just bear with me for a sec.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			You do deserve your partner.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know you don’t believe me now. But like I’ve been saying, maybe it’s not about believing it. Live your life according to the idea that you are worth not only your partner’s time, but also your own. And maybe the believing part will come with time.
