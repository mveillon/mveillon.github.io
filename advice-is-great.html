		<h1> Relationship advice is great. But only you can make a decision for your life </h1>
		<p> May 2nd, 2019 </p>
		<p> 
			There will be plenty of times when you won’t have the answers. There will be plenty of times when you will need some help from someone else. That’s probably why you’re here, right?
		</p>
		<p>
			And there’s nothing wrong with that. I created this blog because relationships are hard, and I think everyone needs a little help at one point or another. That said, this blog is also founded on the idea that there is no one-size-fits-all advice. I can throw ideas out there in hopes that it will be of meaning to someone. But the truth is: you are the only person who can make a decision for your life.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know this may sound a little intimidating. But bear in mind that I’m not asking you to figure everything out on your own. Asking for help or advice is a good thing; I encourage it. But the final decision has to be yours. Otherwise, you won’t be happy with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let me explain:
		</p>
		<p>
			When someone throws out ideas for you to try, you usually have an instinctive reaction. If you ask someone advice and they offer you option A and option B – even if you don’t realize at first – you probably know, right off the bat, how you feel about each one.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here’s an example.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you’re indecisive like me, ordering off a menu is a struggle. Menus can be long and intimidating, and the more options there are, the more stuck you can get. Let’s say you’ve narrowed it down to two different meals, but you can’t decide between the two. If you ask someone to pick for you, you might feel an automatic burst of disappointment at what they choose. That probably means you actually already knew that you wanted the other one.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I’m saying here is: advice can be very helpful, but not always because the person you’re asking has the perfect solution. Sometimes they give you ideas that you actually hate, but that’s information. Sometimes, when you’re stuck in your own head, it can be hard to even know how you feel or what you want. But, if someone else throws out an idea and you have a very negative reaction to it, that can narrow it down for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			I suppose what I’m saying here is: even though it is so easy to get caught up in indecision, I think everyone instinctively knows what they need and want. It just might not be clear until you try on an idea and see how you feel about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, if you take someone’s advice, and you feel good about it, you’re still making the ultimate decision. You’re choosing to follow their advice because you feel good about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If someone gives you advice, it might also spark your own idea of a solution. That’s also you using other people’s advice as a way to make your own decision. It’s just a little different.
		</p>
		<p>
			So the takeaway is: asking advice is very valuable, but always make your own decision based on your life and your knowledge of yourself. You’re the only one who really knows what’s right for you.
