		<h1> You'll never have all the answers, and that's okay </h1>
		<p> May 2nd, 2019 </p>

			Especially when we’re young, we tend to expect ourselves to have everything figured out. We feel like we should be on the same level as everyone else. And it’s easy to feel like everyone else knows what’s going on and you just missed the memo.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reality is: no one has everything figured out.

			Yes, there are people with more experience, and maybe there are even people with more success than you. But that doesn’t mean they have all the answers. No one does. And that applies to pretty much everything in life.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you see someone with a lot of confidence in their relationships, chances are they have done plenty of struggling with dating in the past. We learn from mistakes.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Mistakes give us wisdom, and wisdom sets you up for a successful relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			So remind yourself that you don’t need to have all the answers. And that is completely okay.
		</p>
		<p>
			That said – you will gain wisdom from doing your best and doing what you think is right. Don’t expect yourself to do everything perfectly, but hold yourself accountable. None of this is meant to discourage you from doing your best. Relationships are hard enough, you don’t need to make it harder by not putting in the effort.
		</p>
		<p>
			There’s nothing wrong with asking advice. There’s nothing wrong with having high expectations for yourself. But in the end, you will have to figure most things out on your own, and you will not handle everything perfectly. That’s okay. That’s how everything is.
		</p>
		<p>
			It can be daunting to know that there’s always going to be a certain amount of mystery in a relationship. But that’s half the fun.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Remember that your partner may be struggling too.
		</p>
		<p>
			In fact, it can be nice to be able to navigate the struggles of a relationship together. Once you each recognize and accept the fact that there will always be new obstacles and roadblocks, it can be easier to laugh and make peace with the uncertainty of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don’t be too hard on yourself. You’ll keep learning and gaining wisdom. And maybe it doesn’t matter if you figure it all out. Sometimes wisdom is recognizing and embracing your lack of knowledge.
