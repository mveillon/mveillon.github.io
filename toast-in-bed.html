		<h1> Toast in Bed </h1>
		<p> I learned the other day that there are people in this world who will lie in bed and eat toast. These people are the same species as me, with just as much experience with beds as me. Who in their right mind would eat toast in bed? What possible outcome could there be other than Crumb City? That sounds absolutely terrible. It is borderline masochistic. I understand that I am more organized than an average person. I value cleanliness highly, and not everyone is the same way. There is no excuse for eating toast while lying in bed.  </p>
