		<h1> Even the best relationships take effort </h1>
		<p> May 2nd, 2019 </p>
		<p>
			We all know that no relationship is perfect. But sometimes the idealist inside us reallllly wants to believe that someone out there is going to swoop in and carry us off into the sunset of happily-ever-after.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know. It’s a nice fantasy. And you’re allowed to indulge in it.
		</p>
		<p>
			But...it’s not going to happen. Even the ideal relationship is going to take effort, from both parties.
		</p>
		<p>
			The good news is, when you really love someone and want to be with them, you will have the motivation to put in the effort it takes. In fact, with the right partner, there will be times when it will feel easy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other side of that is, if your relationship always feels hard (or feels hard from the beginning), or if you’re putting in far more effort than your partner – that may be a sign that your relationship needs some work. Worst case scenario, you might be in the wrong relationship altogether.
		</p>
		<p>
			But we’re here to discuss the reality of healthy relationships.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the beginning of a relationship, during what is often called the “honeymoon phase”, everything will probably feel pretty magical and effortless. If you’re in that stage, please, enjoy it, savor it. It’s one of the special parts of dating that needs to be valued. If you spend this time dreading what will happen what this phase is over, you won’t enjoy a bit of it. And what’s the fun in that?
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s important to add, if you’re dreading what will follow the honeymoon phase, try to be realistic without being nihilistic. I have often fallen into that particular mind-trap – and trust me, it’s not worth your time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Realistically, if you’re in a good relationship that works for you and the other person, the end of the honeymoon phase will not result in a sudden drop in your feelings for each other, or your happiness together. Most likely, it will be more of a gradual sense of settling into your relationship. Yes, the novelty of having a new partner may wear off over time, but the comfort and stability of a more long-term commitment can be an incredible source of joy too – just in its own way.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, once you’ve been dating more than a few months, harder and more intense things may crop up. That’s normal, and not a sign of an unhealthy relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			The truth is, after you’ve become more serious with your partner, things will get complicated. You’ll have to navigate more complex issues, and the better you know someone, the more different aspects of their personality will enter the picture.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you really love someone, it will probably feel worth it to navigate any of these complications. But you will have to put in a lot of time and energy for it to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			There will be issues you’ll have to compromise on. There will be moments when you will have to really think and consider how to move forward. You’ll have to have hard conversations about your future. You’ll have to really listen to each other’s needs and concerns. You’ll have to speak up for yourself and what you need – which is often something that very selfless people will forget about. Yes, it’s incredibly important to listen to and care for your partner. But you absolutely must care for yourself as well. It’s just irresponsible not to.
		</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps most importantly – because it’s easy to look over in the face of all the complications of a serious relationship –
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			You need to care for the relationship itself.
		</p>
		<p> 
			A romantic relationship is very unique. Not only did you choose this person – you chose to align your life with theirs in perhaps the closest way one can. It’s a big deal, and in a hard moment, it can be easy to forget why you made that choice.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ask yourself:
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			What made me fall in love with this person?
		</p>
		<p>
			Remind yourself of what it was like in the beginning. What drew you to your partner? What about them made you smile or laugh out loud? What made you want to spend your time and energy on them? And then, think to yourself:
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			How can I show this person that I still care?
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if you’re in a highly established relationship, and even if you and your partner trust each other to still care for one another, it’s so important that you keep up those random acts of kindness or little romantic gestures that you used to do when you first started dating.
		</p>
		<p>
			Things like:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> 
				Buying them flowers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Writing them a little note before work/class.
			</li>
			<li>
				Making them a lunch.
			</li>
			<li>
				Giving them kisses goodbye/hello.
			</li>
			<li>
				Giving an unexpected gift.
			</li>
			<li>
				Going on dates, no matter how established your relationship is.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Every relationship, even the very best of the best, require attention and, if you will, constant maintenance. The more you keep up these little romantic moments, the more you and your partner will keep in mind why you are together in the first place.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Love is a choice, and you need to remember why you made that choice.
		</p>
		<p>
			In sum:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Your relationship will always take effort.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want your relationship to last, you need to put in that effort, no matter how things are going.
			</li>
			<li>
				It’s only worth it if you remember why you love them and why you want to be with them.
			</li>
			<li>
				It’s okay to make the effort you put in fun.
			</li>
		</ul>
