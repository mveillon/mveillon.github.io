		<h1> Does my relationship have a future </h1>
		<p>
			Early in a relationship, it’s hard to answer this question. But it’s also not very relevant yet. Once you’re past the early stages though, it’s natural to start wondering what the next step is. And a lot of that relies on how long your relationship is really going to last.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, I can’t give you an easy test that will answer all of your questions. I wish it were that simple.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I can do is give you some questions to ask yourself and mull over. Even if they don’t predict the exact path of your current relationship, they might help you clarify what you want, and what is realistic.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			What are your goals in this relationship? In life?
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s important to consider your own goals. Relationships are about two people who share their lives – not about two people with the same life. Devoting your entire life to your partner will leave you unsatisfied and probably lead to unhealthy dependency. Besides, everyone has their own opinions and hopes for the future – it’s important to be aware of yours.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if you don’t know where your relationship is going, you’ve probably had thoughts or hopes for what could happen. If you imagine an ideal path for your relationship, where do you see it going? If you could have it your way, how would things go?
		</p>
		<p>
			But it’s not just about your goals in the relationship – what are your goals for your life in general? Where are you in your education or career? What do you hope to accomplish in your life, separate from your partner?
		</p>
		<p>
			Just because you’re sharing your life with your partner does not mean you can’t have your own personal goals. Knowing yourself and knowing what you want and need is the first step to having any idea where your relationship may be going.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Does your relationship inspire you to be the best you can be?
		</p>
		<p>
			Related to the previous question, this one also helps you clarify your side of the deal. A relationship is a partnership between two separate people, but it does have a strong effect on each individual.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example: Let’s say you’re dating someone that perhaps you aren’t as compatible with as you originally thought. Because their personality, or perhaps their goals or needs, don’t compliment yours, you might end up feeling negatively toward yourself. You might feel less confident, because you’re comparing yourself to what your partner wants versus who you actually are. This one is tricky because it can happen even in healthy relationships. Sometimes it takes a long time to figure out how compatible you really are.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another example: You’ve found someone you feel really good with. Your personalities are similar, but not too similar. Your interests overlap, but you have different strengths to bring to the table. You admire each other – and because of this, you strive to be the best person you can be. And it’s not just about pleasing them. It’s about truly being inspired to be the kind of person you want to see in the mirror each day.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your relationship feels a bit like the second example, then that’s a good sign. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to be married within the next month, but hey, it certainly is an integral piece of this puzzle.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Would you be willing to make sacrifices for your partner?
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m going to get real with you for a sec. Romance is thrilling and new and fun, but in a long-term relationship, it gets a whole lot more complicated.
		</p>
		<p>
			New pieces come into play: money, each of your careers, kids maybe, and anything and everything life feels like throwing at you. In a committed relationship, you need to be able to make decisions together. And sometimes, you’ll have to make sacrifices for the sake of your partner, or your relationship. They will have to do the same for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a big question, and it’s easy to get stressed out by it. Start small. Try weighing your priorities in your head and see where your relationship with your partner falls. Don’t judge yourself, and trust your instincts.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Do you feel ready to commit? Not just to them, to anyone?
		</p>
		<p>
			Where your relationship could go hinges on this one.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your goal when dating is to settle down with one person, this is a big question, and it can be hard know the answer. We tend to put pressure on ourselves when it comes to questions like this. If that’s something that happens to you, start with the general question: Am I ready to commit to anyone?
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don’t want to, or feel ready to share your life with someone in this way, then there’s not much point in wondering whether you could commit to your current partner. Maybe you just aren’t in the right place in your life for that kind of relationship, and that’s okay. There is never a rush.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if you do feel ready to share your life with someone, you might be able to clarify a little further with the next question.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Can you picture your future without your partner?
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a very indecisive person. I tend to explore all possible scenarios so thoroughly that I can’t quite decide what I want. Something that has helped a lot with this is picturing myself in one scenario or another and trying to decide which one feels better in my mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			...Is this weird and convoluted? Just bear with me for a second, I swear it helps.
		</p>
		<p>
			If this is confusing, let me give an example:
		</p>
		<p>
			At one point, I was trying to answer the exact questions we’re addressing in this post – does my relationship have a future? I knew I wanted it to, but I couldn’t tell how serious it really was. I definitely had an instinct, but it was hard for me to hear it through the noise in my head. So:
		</p>
		<p>
			I tried picturing myself with my partner in 10 years. I tried to imagine getting married and having kids. I imagined creating our life together. I even imagined being old with them. All of these thoughts gave me a warm, contented feeling, like everything made sense.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, I pictured a future without them. I tried to picture ending up with someone else. The thought automatically triggered a sense of wrongness, an immediate negative reaction. I felt sad and disappointed. But mostly I just couldn’t quite get the image to sharpen, the scenario to truly play out in my head. It just seemed so unlikely to me that I almost immediately rejected it as totally ridiculous.
		</p>
		<p>
			See what I mean?
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			Are you willing to have a conversation about your future with your partner?
		</p>
		<p>
			If, by this point, you’ve clarified your own hopes for the future, you’re left only with this one.
		</p>
		<p>
			Half of the battle is figuring out what you want. But the other half is having that conversation and finding out what your partner wants. This is a joint process, and though you have sped it along by doing some soul-searching on your own, this bit is unavoidable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Approaching this kind of subject can be scarier than eating an oyster for the first time. It’s hard to know the right moment, or the right way to start the conversation. But if you have high hopes for your future – and if you think they might share those hopes – it might be time to push through that fear and share how you feel. For all you know, your partner might be struggling to find a way to approach the same subject with you.
