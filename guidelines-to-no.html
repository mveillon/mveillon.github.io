		<h1> 6 guidelines to the art of saying no </h1>
		<p> 
			Oh man. What a big topic. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Listen friends. This is so so important to me, and even though we do talk about it, I don’t think we talk about it as thoroughly as I would like.
		</p>
		<p>
			By the way, this is about more than just sex. Saying what you want in a sexual setting is incredibly important, but I want to talk more broadly than just that. Saying no and saying what you want is important in a relationship regardless of whether it’s about sex, or where you go for dinner. Making yourself heard is part of being healthy yourself, as well as in the context of a relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			Okay. Let’s get into it.

			6 Guidelines to the Art of Saying No
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			#1. You have to be assertive.
		</p>
		<p>
			This one is a hard one. I know that I’ve struggled with it for a long time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve had to really think about it, and I have a few ideas for why being assertive is so hard. I think a big part of it is that being assertive implies that you have a right to be heard, and I right to be listened to. For anxious and insecure folks like me, this almost impossibly scary. Even if you do, deep down, know that you have a right to be heard, it’s terrifying to stand by that in front of someone else. Yes, even someone you love and you know loves you.
		</p>
		<p>
			But being assertive is important enough that I’ve had to work on conquering my fear. It’s a work in progress, and perhaps always will be. But that’s okay – the important thing is that we recognize what it does for us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asserting your needs and asking for what you want is a core part of open communication. And we have established that open communication is a core part of a relationship. No matter how you look at it, having an open dialogue about your needs and wants is always necessary. After all, your partner isn’t a mind-reader, and neither are you.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			#2.There’s a difference between being assertive and being aggressive.
		</p>
		<p>
			The word “assertive” can give a lot of people the wrong impression. I think it’s because it’s easy to equate being assertive with being aggressive. Don’t worry, I’ve made that mistake before.
		</p>
		<p>
			The major difference between these two words is that one is standing up for yourself while still keeping in mind the other person’s needs, and the other is not so much standing up for yourself as pushing your needs onto someone else. Aggression has no place in a relationship. Asserting yourself includes staying respectful toward your partner, as well as keeping the communication open and two-sided.
		</p>
		<p class  = 'bold'>
			#3. If you let someone walk all over you, you’re not in a healthy relationship, and you’re not respecting yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Listen, I know I have a policy of not telling people what to do. I want everyone to figure out their path on their own. But sometimes the line is clear and unavoidable. More than that, sometimes I have to make the choice to value your safety and health over that policy of letting you figure it out alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you’re not standing up for yourself, and your partner isn’t encouraging you to, that just plain isn’t healthy. If communication is at the core of a relationship, then a relationship without it is missing something vital.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know that communication is way harder than it sounds. But if you don’t have a balanced way of communicating, your relationship will pay the price. I don’t want that to happen to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			But more than anything else, it’s just respectful of yourself to communicate what you need and want. If you’re never standing up for yourself, you’re doing yourself a disservice. Again:
		</p>

			You have a right to be heard.

			#4. ‘Going along’ with something isn’t avoiding conflict. It’s just putting it off.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hey. I’ve been there. When you’re in a situation that you’re not quite sure about, it’s easy to think: “it’s fine, I’ll just see where it goes.” And sometimes, if the stakes aren’t high, that isn’t a bad thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			But other times, it can cause a whole lot more problems than you started with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since saying no often is associated with sex, we’ll use that as an example.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let’s say your partner, or someone you are in sexual contact with, tries to initiate when you aren’t quite up for it/interested. It can feel like it would be easier to just go along with it and not make a fuss. But what happens if the experience turns out to be incredibly unpleasant? What if this turns into a recurring pattern? What if your partner/sexual partner finds out and feels like they’ve done something horrible to you?
		</p>
		<p>
			See what I mean? It can, very quickly, cause all sorts of problems that you might not have foreseen. In reality, “going along” with something isn’t the path of least resistance at all.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			#5. Your partner will also be better off if you stand up for what you want/don’t want.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I said before, if you don’t stand up for yourself, and your partner finds out later, it can cause them to feel horribly guilty.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can say this from experience. Many of us don’t stand up for ourselves not because we’re afraid of how our partner would react, but because we’re simply afraid of doing it at all. But if your partner is a conscious and kind person, they would hate to know that they had done something that you weren’t okay with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your partner deserves to know what’s going on in your end of things, the same way you deserve to know what’s going on in theirs.
		</p>
		<p class = 'bold'>
			#6. If your partner doesn’t listen, get out of that relationship
		</p>
		<p>
			I know, I’m doing it again. Normally I avoid doing this with a passion.
		</p>
		<p>
			But this situation is very different. If your partner isn’t listening to you when you ask for what you want or say no, that can turn real bad, real quick.
		</p>
		<p>
			An important part of trust is knowing that the other person would never hurt you intentionally. But if someone isn’t listening to you, that is a subtle way of breaking your trust. It can be easy to ignore if it’s over something fairly insignificant, like where you go out to dinner one night. But if this is a pattern in your relationship? That’s a really bad sign.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you think it might be a lack of awareness on their part, try having a conversation about it. But honestly, if it’s about anything more serious than where you go for a date, it might not even be worth it.

			You have a right to be heard. 
		</p>
		<p>
			No one should be allowed to convince you otherwise.
